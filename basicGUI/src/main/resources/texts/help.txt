Project 2025 - Basic GUI with Threads

Welcome to Project 2025! This application is a simple text file viewer featuring a dynamic, animated background. It demonstrates key concepts in Java Swing, including multithreading for file I/O (using SwingWorker) and custom component drawing (using a dedicated animation thread).

1. File Menu Operations

The "File" menu provides basic file operations:

Open file: Opens a standard file chooser dialog. Select a plain text file (.txt, .log, etc.) to load its contents into the main text area. A loading message and indeterminate progress bar will appear in the status bar during the load process, performed safely in a background thread.
Close file: Clears the content of the main text area and resets the status bar message.
Exit: Closes the application.

2. Status Bar

Located at the bottom of the window, the Status Bar displays the current state of the application:
Ready: The default state.
Loading file...: Displayed while a file is being read.
File loaded/File closed: Confirmation messages.
Progress Bar: An indeterminate progress bar is shown during file loading operations.

3. Settings Menu (Animated Background Configuration)

The "Settings" menu allows you to customize the animated gradient background:

Pattern: Choose the type of gradient to be drawn:
    Diagonal Linear
    Basic Radial
    Vertical Linear
Colors: Opens a color chooser for you to select **two colors** (First Color and Second Color). The animation will interpolate and cycle between these two colors.
Speed: Adjusts the speed of the color animation, from 0.5x (slower) to 2.0x (faster).

Note: Changes made in the "Settings" menu are applied instantly to the animated background. If the animation is not running, it will automatically start when a setting is changed.

4. Help Menu

Help: Opens this current window.
About: Shows general information about the project and its logo.
